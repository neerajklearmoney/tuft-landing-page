Neeraj had a vision. Years ago, he started a humble club, a platform where like-minded individuals could share, learn, and collaborate. Over the years, this small club grew exponentially, reaching a whopping 10,000 users. The time had come for Neeraj to make a move he'd long dreamt of: organizing a grand webinar with a special guest. Excitement bubbling, he set up a registration form, expecting a few hundred attendees. But to his amazement, over 2,000 individuals signed up!

Faced with such enthusiasm, Neeraj faced a challenge he hadn't anticipated. Where would he host such a massive online event? YouTube was too public, turning his exclusive webinar into an open broadcast. Google Meet and Zoom, on the other hand, would require hefty payments to accommodate such a crowd.

Enter **Tuft's Meetings**. A beacon in Neeraj's moment of uncertainty, this feature presented the perfect solution.

## **Why Tuft's Meetings?**

Designed with scalability in mind, Tuft's Meetings allows club organizers, educators, and leaders like Neeraj to hold video conferences with no limits on hours or participants. Here's a glance at the plethora of features Tuft's Meetings offers:

1. **No Participant Limit:** The Sky's the Limit!.

   Gone are the days when the number of participants dictated the choice of your platform. With Tuft's Meetings, you can confidently host webinars and meetings without fretting about participant caps. Whether you're hosting an intimate team meeting or broadcasting a seminar to thousands, Tuft ensures everyone gets a seat at the table.

2. **Boundless Calls:** Freedom to Connect

   Be it one, ten, or a hundred sessions; Tuft understands that communication shouldn't be constrained. You're given the liberty to host as many sessions as necessary, ensuring your team or community remains connected and informed whenever the need arises.

3. **Unlimited Hours:** Time is On Your Side

   Every conversation is unique. Some may wrap up in minutes, while others demand hours of in-depth discussion. With Tuft's Meetings, you're no longer watching the clock. From quick sync-ups to extensive workshops, you have the time and space to cover everything on the agenda.

4. **Timely Reminders:** Never Miss a Beat

   With our lives getting busier, it's easy to forget or overlook scheduled events. Tuft's built-in reminder system is here to change that. Receive timely notifications and reminders, ensuring you and your participants are always on the same page, and no crucial meeting is missed.

5. **Screen Sharing: A Picture's Worth a Thousand Words**

   Whether you're pitching an idea, conducting a tutorial, or simply sharing a memory, visuals can make all the difference. Tuft's Meetings offers an intuitive screen sharing feature, allowing presenters to enhance their explanations and truly engage with their audience.

## **Tuft's Meetings Vs. Google Meet or Zoom**

You might wonder, with existing platforms like Google Meet and Zoom, why should one consider Tuft's Meetings? Here's how Tuft stands out:

- **Cost Efficiency:** Unlike Zoom or Google Meet, where large meetings could demand premium subscriptions, Tuft offers its expansive features entirely for free.

## **Dive into the Future of Group Communication**

The digital realm has given rise to a myriad of communication tools. However, as Neeraj's story illustrates, not all tools can cater to every unique requirement, especially when it's about hosting a vast audience without burning a hole in the pocket.
